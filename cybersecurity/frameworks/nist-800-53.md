# NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 — Security and Privacy Controls

**Issuing body:** National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
**Version:** Revision 5
**Published:** September 2020 (updated December 2020)
**Document:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5

---

## Purpose

NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls for
information systems and organizations. It is the definitive control catalog for U.S. federal
information systems and has become a widely adopted reference for private sector organizations
seeking a rigorous, comprehensive control framework. Rev 5 added privacy controls as a first-class
element and introduced supply chain risk management controls.

## Structure

800-53 is organized as: **Control Families → Controls → Control Enhancements**

- **20 control families** — logical groupings by security topic
- **~1,000+ controls and enhancements** — specific technical and procedural requirements
- **3 baselines** — Low, Moderate, and High impact baselines define which controls apply at each
  risk level

Organizations typically implement 800-53 by selecting a baseline appropriate to the system's
impact level, then tailoring up (adding controls) or down (excluding controls) based on risk.

## Control Families

| Family | ID | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Access Control | AC | Manage access to systems, applications, and data |
| Awareness and Training | AT | Security awareness and role-based training |
| Audit and Accountability | AU | Create, protect, and retain audit records |
| Assessment, Authorization, Monitoring | CA | Assess and authorize systems; continuous monitoring |
| Configuration Management | CM | Establish and maintain baseline configurations |
| Contingency Planning | CP | Establish and test incident recovery plans |
| Identification and Authentication | IA | Identify and authenticate users and devices |
| Incident Response | IR | Establish and operate incident response capability |
| Maintenance | MA | Perform maintenance on systems |
| Media Protection | MP | Protect physical and digital media |
| Physical and Environmental Protection | PE | Protect physical facilities and equipment |
| Planning | PL | Develop and document security plans |
| Program Management | PM | Enterprise-level security program management |
| Personnel Security | PS | Screen individuals; manage access termination |
| PII Processing and Transparency | PT | Privacy controls for personally identifiable information |
| Risk Assessment | RA | Assess risks; operate vulnerability management |
| System and Services Acquisition | SA | Secure system development and acquisition |
| System and Communications Protection | SC | Protect systems and communications |
| System and Information Integrity | SI | Identify and remediate flaws; protect from malware |
| Supply Chain Risk Management | SR | Manage supply chain risks for systems and components |

## Impact Baselines

Controls are assigned to baselines based on the potential impact of a security breach:

| Baseline | When to use | Example system types |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Low** | Loss of CIA would have limited adverse effect | Public-facing informational websites, low-sensitivity internal tools |
| **Moderate** | Loss of CIA would have serious adverse effect | Most federal systems; common enterprise systems with sensitive data |
| **High** | Loss of CIA would have severe or catastrophic effect | Financial systems, health records, critical infrastructure controls |

**Tailoring:** Organizations start from a baseline and tailor by adding overlays (e.g., for
specific sectors, cloud environments, or IoT) or removing controls with documented justification.

---

## Key Additions in Rev 5

- **Privacy controls fully integrated** — PT family added; privacy merged throughout
- **Supply Chain Risk Management** — new SR family for supply chain threats
- **Outcomes-based** — controls state desired outcomes, allowing implementation flexibility
- **Mappings to ISO 27001** — explicit cross-reference published by NIST
- **Consolidated control catalog** — previously separate privacy catalog merged

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

| Framework | Relationship |
|-----------|-------------|
| NIST CSF 2.0 | CSF subcategories map to 800-53 controls; 800-53 is the detailed implementation guidance for CSF; see `frameworks/nist-csf-2.0.md` |
| ISO 27001:2022 | NIST publishes an explicit mapping; significant overlap especially in Moderate baseline; see `frameworks/iso-27001.md` |
| FedRAMP | FedRAMP baselines are derived from 800-53 baselines; FedRAMP authorization requires 800-53 compliance |
| CMMC 2.0 | CMMC Level 2 maps to NIST 800-171 (a subset of 800-53 for CUI); Level 3 maps to additional 800-53 controls; see `frameworks/cmmc.md` |
| SOC 2 | TSC criteria map to 800-53 control families; 800-53 compliance provides evidence for SOC 2 controls |

## Assessment Approach

**For federal systems:** System Security Plan (SSP) documents control implementations; Security
Assessment Report (SAR) documents independent testing; Authorization to Operate (ATO) granted
based on residual risk.

**For private sector:** Use 800-53 as a control catalog to identify gaps. Common approaches:
1. Select applicable baseline based on system sensitivity
2. Map existing controls to 800-53 families
3. Identify gaps using the gap analysis template in the compliance-assessment skill
4. Prioritize remediation using risk-based approach (not all controls are equal)

## Regulatory Context

| Sector / Program | Requirement |
|-----------------|-------------|
| U.S. federal agencies | Mandatory under FISMA; implemented via NIST RMF |
| Cloud providers (FedRAMP) | Required for FedRAMP authorization |
| DoD contractors | 800-171 (800-53 subset) required for handling CUI; CMMC 2.0 |
| Healthcare (HIPAA) | HHS recommends 800-53 as implementation guidance for HIPAA Security Rule |
| Financial services | FFIEC references; OCC and Fed guidance references |
