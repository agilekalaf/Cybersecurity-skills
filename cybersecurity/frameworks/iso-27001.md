# ISO/IEC 27001:2022 — Information Security Management Systems

**Issuing body:** International Organization for Standardization (ISO) / International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
**Version:** ISO/IEC 27001:2022
**Published:** October 2022 (supersedes ISO/IEC 27001:2013)
**Transition deadline:** October 31, 2025 (organizations certified to 2013 version must transition)

---

## Purpose

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and
continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). Unlike control catalogs
(NIST 800-53) or maturity frameworks (NIST CSF), ISO 27001 is a management system standard —
it requires an integrated, systematic approach to information security governance, with independent
third-party certification available. Certification demonstrates to customers, partners, and regulators
that the organization has a formally governed and independently audited security program.

---

## Key Changes in 2022 Version

- **Annex A restructured:** Controls reorganized from 14 clauses / 114 controls to **4 themes / 93 controls**
- **11 new controls added** (including threat intelligence, cloud security, data masking, ICT supply chain)
- **Controls tagged with attributes:** Each control has attributes for control type, security property,
  cybersecurity concept, operational capability, and security domain — enabling filtering and mapping
- **Alignment with ISO/IEC 27002:2022** for implementation guidance

## ISMS Requirements (Clauses 4-10)

ISO 27001 certification requires demonstrating conformance with clauses 4-10. These are not
negotiable — all must be met.

| Clause | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **4. Context** | Understand the organization, interested parties, and ISMS scope |
| **5. Leadership** | Top management commitment; ISMS policy; roles and responsibilities |
| **6. Planning** | Risk assessment and treatment; information security objectives |
| **7. Support** | Resources, competence, awareness, communication, documented information |
| **8. Operation** | Implement risk treatment; manage change; outsourcing |
| **9. Performance evaluation** | Monitoring, measurement, internal audit, management review |
| **10. Improvement** | Corrective action; continual improvement |

## Annex A Controls — 4 Themes

### Organizational Controls (37 controls) — Theme A.5
Policy, roles, threat intelligence, information classification, supplier relationships,
incident management, business continuity, legal compliance, and more.

Key controls:
- A.5.1 Policies for information security
- A.5.7 Threat intelligence (NEW in 2022)
- A.5.19–5.22 Supplier/supply chain security
- A.5.23 Information security for use of cloud services (NEW in 2022)

### People Controls (8 controls) — Theme A.6
Screening, employment terms, awareness, training, disciplinary process, remote work,
and confidentiality agreements.

### Physical Controls (14 controls) — Theme A.7
Physical security perimeter, entry controls, desk/screen policies, physical media disposal,
equipment security.

### Technological Controls (34 controls) — Theme A.8
Key technical controls:
- A.8.2 Privileged access rights
- A.8.5 Secure authentication
- A.8.7 Protection against malware
- A.8.8 Management of technical vulnerabilities
- A.8.11 Data masking (NEW in 2022)
- A.8.12 Data leakage prevention (NEW in 2022)
- A.8.16 Monitoring activities (NEW in 2022)
- A.8.23 Web filtering (NEW in 2022)
- A.8.24 Use of cryptography
- A.8.28 Secure coding (NEW in 2022)

## Certification Process

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **ISMS implementation** | Build and operate the ISMS; implement Annex A controls per risk treatment plan |
| **Internal audit** | Required by clause 9.2; audit ISMS conformance before external certification |
| **Management review** | Required by clause 9.3; leadership reviews ISMS performance |
| **Stage 1 audit** | Certifying body reviews documentation and ISMS design |
| **Stage 2 audit** | Certifying body tests operational effectiveness through evidence review and interviews |
| **Certification granted** | 3-year certificate issued if conformance demonstrated |
| **Surveillance audits** | Annual surveillance audits at Years 1 and 2 to maintain certification |
| **Recertification** | Full audit at Year 3 for 3-year renewal |

---

## Statement of Applicability (SoA)

The SoA is a required document listing all 93 Annex A controls with:
- Whether each control is applicable or excluded
- Justification for exclusions
- Implementation status
- Reference to evidence of implementation

The SoA is audited — certifying bodies review it in detail. AI can assist with drafting the
SoA, but the applicability decisions require human judgment and must be made by the organization's
ISMS team.

---

## Assessment Approach

1. **Clause compliance gap:** Map current ISMS documentation and processes against clauses 4-10
2. **Risk assessment:** Conduct information security risk assessment per clause 6.1
3. **Annex A control selection:** Select applicable controls from Annex A based on risk treatment
4. **SoA drafting:** Document control applicability and implementation status
5. **Implementation and evidence:** Implement and operate controls with documented evidence
6. **Internal audit:** Audit before Stage 2 to find and fix gaps
7. **Stage 1 readiness:** Ensure documentation is complete and ISMS is defined
8. **Stage 2 readiness:** Ensure controls are operating and evidence is available

## Mapping to Other Frameworks

| Framework | Mapping |
|-----------|---------|
| NIST CSF 2.0 | NIST publishes ISO 27001 → CSF mapping; strong overlap especially in Protect, Detect, Govern functions; see `frameworks/nist-csf-2.0.md` |
| NIST SP 800-53 | NIST publishes SP 800-53 → ISO 27001 cross-reference; most Moderate baseline controls map to ISO 27001 Annex A |
| SOC 2 | Significant overlap; ISO 27001 certified organizations can often use ISO evidence for SOC 2 population with some gaps |
| CMMC | ISO 27001 is not a CMMC substitute but shares many control objectives |

---

## Regulatory Context

| Sector / Region | Relevance |
|----------------|-----------|
| Global enterprise | ISO 27001 certification widely recognized; required or preferred by major enterprise customers |
| EU / GDPR | ISO 27001 Annex A controls address many GDPR technical/organizational security requirements |
| Financial services (EU) | DORA regulation references ISO 27001-equivalent controls |
| Healthcare | Recognized as HIPAA Security Rule implementation guidance |
| Government supply chain | Many national governments require or prefer ISO 27001 for suppliers |
| Cloud services | Widely required by enterprise customers as baseline security assurance |
