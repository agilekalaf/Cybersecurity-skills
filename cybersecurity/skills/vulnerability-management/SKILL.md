# Vulnerability Management

This skill drives risk-based vulnerability prioritization, remediation tracking, and SLA compliance
monitoring. It moves beyond raw CVSS scores to incorporate threat intelligence on active exploitation,
asset criticality, and environmental exposure to surface the vulnerabilities that actually matter.
It integrates with the threat-intelligence skill for exploitation context and connects to ticketing
platforms to track remediation through to closure.

> **Philosophy: People Led, AI Driven (PLAID)**
>
> Vulnerability management programs drown in data — thousands of findings, too many to fix at once,
> with no shortage of vendors claiming their scoring tells you what to do first. This skill handles
> the correlation and prioritization logic so security teams can focus on what requires judgment:
> assessing business context for risk acceptance, negotiating remediation timelines with asset owners,
> and making calls on exceptions. Prioritization scores are inputs to human decisions, not substitutes
> for them. A vulnerability rated Critical by CVSS but on an air-gapped test system may be lower
> priority than a Medium-rated flaw on an internet-facing production API — and that context call
> belongs to the analyst.

## Before You Begin

Load your `security.local.md` to calibrate this skill. Key fields used:

- **Vulnerability scanner** — determines which MCP connector to query for scan results
- **SLA targets by severity** — calibrates SLA compliance reporting to your defined targets
- **CMDB / Asset inventory tool** — enables asset criticality enrichment
- **Threat intelligence platforms** — enables exploitation context from CISA KEV and threat feeds
- **Active compliance frameworks** — some frameworks (PCI-DSS, NERC CIP) have specific vulnerability management requirements

---

## Roles This Skill Serves

**Primary:** Security Operations (vulnerability analysts, patch coordinators), Security Architecture

**Also useful for:**
- GRC: framework compliance evidence for vulnerability management controls
- Security Leadership: program metrics, SLA reporting, exception escalation
- Incident Response: post-incident vulnerability identification and remediation tracking

---

## Workflow 1: Risk-Based Vulnerability Prioritization

Use to take scanner output and produce a risk-prioritized remediation list that accounts for
exploitation context, asset criticality, and environmental exposure — not just CVSS scores.

### Inputs for prioritization

```
Scan results:          [Paste summary or provide scanner report reference]
Scan scope:            [Network range | Business unit | Application | Cloud environment]
Scan date:             [Date — results are point-in-time]
Asset context:         [CMDB data, criticality ratings if available]
Environment context:   [Internet-facing systems | Internal only | Cloud | OT-adjacent]
```

### Risk scoring model

The skill applies a composite risk score that weights:

| Factor | Weight | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| CVSS Base Score | 20% | Scanner output |
| CVSS Temporal (exploit code maturity) | 15% | Scanner / NVD |
| CISA KEV listing (confirmed exploitation) | 30% | CISA KEV feed |
| Active exploitation in wild (threat intel) | 20% | Feedly, OpenCTI |
| Asset criticality | 10% | CMDB / analyst input |
| Internet exposure | 5% | CMDB / scanner |

*Organizations should tune these weights to match their risk appetite and environment.*

### Prioritized findings template

```markdown
## Vulnerability Prioritization Report
**Scan date:** [Date]
**Report date:** [Date]
**Scope:** [System / network / application scope]
**Total vulnerabilities in scope:** [N]

### Summary
| Priority | Count | SLA target | Currently within SLA |
|----------|-------|------------|---------------------|
| P1 — Critical (CISA KEV or CVSS 9+ with active exploitation) | [N] | [X days] | [Y/N ([%])] |
| P2 — High (CVSS 7–8.9, no confirmed active exploitation) | [N] | [X days] | |
| P3 — Medium (CVSS 4–6.9) | [N] | [X days] | |
| P4 — Low (<4) | [N] | Scheduled | |

### P1 Vulnerabilities — Remediate Immediately
| CVE | CVSS | Risk score | Asset(s) | Asset criticality | In CISA KEV | Active exploit? | Age (days) | SLA status |
|-----|------|-----------|---------|------------------|-------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| [CVE-XXXX-XXXXX] | [9.8] | [95] | [hostname] | [Critical] | [Yes] | [Yes] | [X] | [Overdue] |

### P2 Vulnerabilities — Remediate per SLA
[Same table, next priority tier]

### Over-SLA items requiring escalation
| CVE | Asset | SLA target | Days overdue | Assigned to | Escalation required |
|-----|-------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [CVE] | [Asset] | [X days] | [Y days] | [Team] | [Yes — to: [Role]] |

### Recommended quick wins
[Vulnerabilities where a single patch or configuration change closes multiple high-priority findings]
```

## Workflow 2: SLA Compliance Dashboard

Use for periodic reporting on remediation progress against defined SLA targets.

### SLA compliance template

```markdown
## Vulnerability Management SLA Report
**Period:** [Month/Quarter]
**Report date:** [Date]

### Overall SLA Compliance
| Severity | SLA target | Closed within SLA | SLA compliance % | Trend |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Critical | [X days] | [N/N] | [%] | [↑/→/↓] |
| High | [X days] | [N/N] | [%] | |
| Medium | [X days] | [N/N] | [%] | |

### Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)
| Severity | Target MTTR | Actual MTTR | Delta |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| Critical | [X days] | [Y days] | [+/-Z] |
| High | [X days] | [Y days] | |
| Medium | [X days] | [Y days] | |

### Top overdue items (by risk score)
[Top 10 overdue vulnerabilities requiring management attention]

### Remediation bottlenecks
[Analysis of where remediations are stalling — patching windows, resource constraints,
application owners not responding, patch compatibility issues]

### Exceptions and risk acceptances
| CVE | Asset | Exception reason | Risk accepted by | Expiry | Review date |
|-----|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| [CVE] | [Asset] | [Justification] | [Name/Role] | [Date] | [Date] |
```

---

## Workflow 3: Vulnerability Exception and Risk Acceptance

Use when a vulnerability cannot be remediated within SLA due to business constraints.

### Exception documentation template

```markdown
## Vulnerability Risk Acceptance
**Exception ID:** [VULN-EXC-YYYY-NNN]
**Requested by:** [Team / individual]
**Requested date:** [Date]

### Vulnerability details
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| CVE | [CVE ID] |
| CVSS | [Score] |
| Description | [Brief description] |
| Affected asset(s) | [Hostname / application] |
| Asset criticality | [Critical / High / Medium / Low] |
| In CISA KEV | [Yes / No] |

### Exception justification
**Business reason for non-remediation:**
[Why this cannot be patched/fixed within SLA — business continuity, compatibility, vendor dependency, etc.]

**Remediation blockers:**
[Specific technical or operational barriers]

**Target remediation date:**
[When remediation is planned — exceptions should not be indefinite]

### Compensating controls
[Controls in place that reduce the risk of exploitation — network segmentation, monitoring,
application-layer controls, WAF rules, etc.]

### Residual risk assessment
**Risk with compensating controls:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Justification:** [Why the compensating controls are sufficient]

### Approvals required
| Risk level | Approver |
|-----------|----------|
| Low | Security Manager |
| Medium | CISO |
| High | CISO + [CRO / relevant executive] |

**Approved by:** _________________________ Date: _________
```

## Integration with Threat Intelligence

This skill is designed to pull exploitation context from the threat-intelligence skill:

- **CISA KEV** — authoritative list of vulnerabilities confirmed exploited in the wild
- **Feedly / OpenCTI** — emerging exploitation intelligence before CISA KEV listing
- **Vendor advisories** — exploitation status from Microsoft, Cisco, etc.

When threat intelligence MCP connectors are available, the prioritization workflow automatically
queries CISA KEV status and checks for recent threat actor exploitation activity before assigning
risk scores.

---

## Working with Tools

### MCP connectors this skill uses

| Connector | Used for | Priority |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Vulnerability Scanner** (Qualys, Tenable, Defender) | Pull scan results, asset inventory, vulnerability details | High — core data source |
| **CISA KEV** | Confirmed exploitation status | High — free, authoritative |
| **Threat Intelligence** (Feedly, OpenCTI) | Active exploitation intelligence beyond KEV | High for prioritization quality |
| **CMDB** (ServiceNow, Axonius) | Asset criticality data | High for accurate risk scoring |
| **Ticketing** (ServiceNow, Jira) | Remediation ticket creation and SLA tracking | Medium |
| **GRC Platform** | Compliance evidence for vulnerability management controls | Low |

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **Does not run vulnerability scans.** It analyzes scan results; actual scanning requires deployed scanner infrastructure.
- **Does not patch systems.** Remediation execution is a change management and operations function.
- **Does not cover application-layer code vulnerabilities (SAST/DAST).** Those belong in the security-architecture-review skill.
- **Does not provide authoritative CVE descriptions.** It synthesizes from NVD and scanner data; always verify against the official CVE database.
- **Does not automatically accept risk.** Exception approvals require human authorization at the level specified in `security.local.md`.
- **Does not replace penetration testing.** Scanner-based vulnerability management and manual penetration testing are complementary — this skill covers the former.
