# Risk Assessment

This skill supports the full security risk management lifecycle — from identifying and assessing
individual risks through maintaining a risk register, quantifying cyber risk in business terms,
assessing third-party and vendor risks, and producing risk reporting for governance audiences.
It supports both qualitative (risk matrix) and quantitative (FAIR-referenced) approaches,
adapting to the methodology specified in your `security.local.md` or the session context.

> **Philosophy: People Led, AI Driven (PLAID)**
>
> Risk assessment is fundamentally a human judgment exercise. AI can structure the analysis,
> apply consistent scoring, surface relevant threat intelligence, and draft risk statements that
> communicate clearly — but the assessments that drive real decisions require human expertise,
> organizational context, and accountability. A risk rating generated by an AI without human
> validation is an opinion, not an assessment. Every risk entry in a risk register should carry
> the name of a human who has reviewed and stands behind the assessment. This skill does the
> analytical drafting; risk owners do the deciding.

## Before You Begin

Load your `security.local.md` to calibrate this skill. Key fields used:

- **Risk appetite** — calibrates what constitutes "acceptable" vs. "unacceptable" residual risk
- **Risk tolerance by category** — tunes scoring thresholds for different risk types
- **Risk acceptance authority** — determines escalation paths for high-risk findings
- **Risk quantification methodology** — selects qualitative or quantitative approach
- **GRC platform** — enables direct risk register update via MCP

---

## Roles This Skill Serves

**Primary:** GRC (risk analysts, compliance managers), Security Leadership (CISO, CRO)

**Also useful for:**
- Security Architecture: architectural risk assessment for design decisions
- IAM: access-related risk analysis for exception documentation
- Vendor / procurement teams: third-party risk assessment support

## Workflow 1: Individual Risk Assessment

Use to assess a specific risk scenario and produce a risk register entry.

### Inputs for risk assessment

```
Risk scenario:       [Describe the risk — what could go wrong, who is affected, what triggers it]
Risk type:           [Operational | Regulatory/Compliance | Reputational | Technology/Cyber |
                      Third-party | Strategic]
Assessment scope:    [System | Process | Business unit | Enterprise]
Threat actors:       [External threat actor | Insider | Natural disaster | Vendor | Unknown]
Current controls:    [What controls are in place that reduce this risk?]
Methodology:         [Qualitative (matrix) | Quantitative (FAIR-referenced) | Both]
```

### Risk register entry template

```markdown
## Risk Register Entry
**Risk ID:** [RISK-YYYY-NNN]
**Date assessed:** [Date]
**Assessed by:** [Name / Role — required for accountability]
**Risk owner:** [Executive or manager accountable for this risk]
**Next review date:** [Date — typically annual or after triggering event]

### Risk Statement
**Risk:** There is a risk that [threat/event] will occur due to [vulnerability/weakness],
resulting in [impact] to [organization/system/process].

### Risk Details
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Risk category | [Operational / Regulatory / Technology / Reputational / Third-party] |
| Threat source | [External attacker / Insider / Vendor / Natural / Process failure] |
| Affected assets | [Systems, data, processes, business functions] |
| Regulatory implications | [Which frameworks or regulations are implicated, if any] |

### Inherent Risk (before controls)

**Qualitative assessment:**
| Factor | Rating | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Likelihood | [1-5: Rare/Unlikely/Possible/Likely/Almost Certain] | [Basis for rating] |
| Impact | [1-5: Negligible/Minor/Moderate/Major/Catastrophic] | [Basis for rating — financial, operational, reputational] |
| Inherent risk level | [Low/Medium/High/Critical] | [From risk matrix] |

**Quantitative assessment (FAIR-referenced, if applicable):**
| Factor | Estimate | Range | Basis |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|
| Threat event frequency (TEF) | [per year] | [low-high] | [Source] |
| Vulnerability (contact frequency × probability of action) | [%] | [range] | |
| Loss event frequency (LEF) | [per year] | [range] | |
| Primary loss magnitude | [$range] | | [Direct costs] |
| Secondary loss magnitude | [$range] | | [Regulatory, reputational] |
| Annualized loss expectancy (ALE) | [$range] | | |

### Current Controls
| Control | Type | Effectiveness | Evidence |
|---------|------|--------------|----------|
| [Control description] | [Preventive / Detective / Corrective] | [High / Medium / Low] | [Where documented] |

### Residual Risk (after controls)
| Factor | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Residual likelihood | [1-5] |
| Residual impact | [1-5] |
| **Residual risk level** | **[Low/Medium/High/Critical]** |

### Risk Treatment
**Selected treatment:** [Accept | Mitigate | Transfer | Avoid]

**Rationale:** [Why this treatment was selected given the residual risk level and risk appetite]

**Treatment plan (if mitigate):**
| Action | Owner | Timeline | Expected risk reduction |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------------|
| [Control improvement] | [Team] | [Date] | [Risk level after action] |

**If Accept:** Risk accepted by: _________________________ Date: _________
(Acceptance authority per `security.local.md` — ensure appropriate level)
```

## Workflow 2: Risk Heat Map Data

Use to generate structured data for risk heat map visualization across a portfolio of risks.

### Risk heat map dataset template

```markdown
## Risk Portfolio Overview
**Period:** [Quarter/Year]
**Scope:** [Enterprise | Business unit | System portfolio]

### Risk landscape (for heat map)
| Risk ID | Risk name | Likelihood | Impact | Residual risk | Trend | Owner |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|--------------|-------|-------|
| RISK-2024-001 | [Brief name] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [L/M/H/C] | [↑/→/↓] | [Owner] |

### Top 5 risks by residual risk level
1. [Risk ID + name + one-sentence description]
2. [Risk ID + name + one-sentence description]
3. [Risk ID + name + one-sentence description]
4. [Risk ID + name + one-sentence description]
5. [Risk ID + name + one-sentence description]

### Risk trends
[What is moving up? What has been successfully mitigated? Any emerging risks?]

### Risk appetite comparison
[For each risk category, are residual risks within stated risk appetite?]
| Category | Appetite | Current exposure | Status |
|----------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Operational | [Low/Med/High] | [Low/Med/High] | [Within appetite / Exceeds appetite] |
| Regulatory | [Low] | [Medium] | [Exceeds appetite — requires escalation] |
```

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **Does not produce actuarial-grade financial loss estimates.** FAIR-referenced estimates are structured approximations, not insurance-grade quantification.
- **Does not replace dedicated enterprise risk management (ERM) programs.** This skill handles cyber risk assessment; ERM programs integrate all risk categories across the enterprise.
- **Does not automate risk acceptance.** Risk acceptance requires an authorized human decision-maker.
- **Does not assess physical security risks.** Physical security risk assessment is out of scope.
- **Does not conduct vendor on-site assessments.** Remote assessment only; on-site third-party audits require qualified assessors.
- **Does not provide insurance or legal advice.** Cyber insurance and regulatory liability have professional expertise requirements beyond AI-assisted risk assessment.
